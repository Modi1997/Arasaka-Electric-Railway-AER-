**Overview**

Welcome to the Arasaka Electric Railway (AER) Data Analysis project repository. The purpose of this project is to conduct data analysis and exploratory analysis to identify features that influence the overall experience of the customers. Additionally, the project aims to implement and compare the performance of five machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaBoost, and Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF SVM). The ultimate goal is to create a highly accurate classification model to enhance the business operations and customer satisfaction of AER.

**Project Structure**

The repository contains the following components:

Data Analysis Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis and exploratory analysis of the dataset to identify key features affecting customer experience.

Machine Learning Model Implementation Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook implements and evaluates the performance of the five machine learning algorithms mentioned above.

Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis and model training.

Results: Contains visualizations, evaluation metrics, and summaries of model performance.

**Usage**

To replicate or extend the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the appropriate notebook in the "Data Analysis Notebooks" or "Machine Learning Model Implementation Notebooks" directories.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.
Make modifications or additions as needed for your specific use case.

**Dependencies**

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
  
Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the notebooks.

**Contributions**

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to submit a pull request.
